# Whisp test

## Instruction
1. Clone this repository

3. Start project with `npm run start` or `yarn start`
4. The exercise will be displayed in the app's main page.




<h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A list of Nodes, each with a reference to their parent, should be displayed hierarchically</li>
          <li>The user should be able to select one or many nodes arbitrarily</li>
          <li>Selected nodes should be visually highlighted somehow</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bonus tasks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The user should be able to select groups (a node and its <u>immediate</u> children, no recursion required) without selecting every node
            individually).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The solution does not need to be visually styled in any special way.
          The hierarchy and the selection should be visible of course.
        </p>

Good luck!
